Archipelago fuzzer
==================

This is a fairly dumb fuzzer that will generate multiworlds with N random YAMLs and record failures.

## How to run this?

You need to run archipelago from source. If you don't know how to do that, there's documentation from the archipelago project [here](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/blob/main/docs/running%20from%20source.md)

Copy the `fuzz.py` file at the root of the archipelago project, you can then run the fuzzer like any other archipelago entry point:

```
python fuzz.py -r 100 -j 16 -g alttp -n 1
```

This will run 100 tests on the alttp world, with 1 YAML per generation, using 16 jobs.
The output will be available in `./fuzz_output`.

## Flags

- `-g` selects the apworld to fuzz. If omitted, every run will take a random loaded world
- `-j` specifies the number of jobs to run in parallel. Defaults to 10, recommended value is the number of cores of your CPU.
- `-r` specifies the number of generations to do. This is a mandatory setting
- `-n` specifies how many YAMLs to use per generation. Defaults to 1. You can
  also specify ranges like `1-10` to make all generations pick a number between
  1 and 10 YAMLs.
- `-t` specifies the maximum time per generation in seconds. Defaults to 15s.
- `-m` to specify a meta file that overrides specific values
- `--skip-output` specifies to skip the output step of generation.
- `--dump-ignored` makes it so option errors are also dumped in the result.
- `--with-static-worlds` takes a path to a directory containing YAML to include in every generation. Not recursive.
- `--hook` takes a `module:class` string to a hook and can be specified multiple times. More information about that below

## Meta files

You can force some options to always be the same value by providing a meta file via the `-m` flag.
The syntax is very similar to the archipelago meta.yaml syntax:

```yaml
null:
  progression_balancing: 50
Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen:
  ability_blacklist: []
  move_blacklist: []
```

Note that unlike an archipelago meta file, this will override the values in the
generated YAML, there's no implicit application of options at generation time
so you don't need to provide the meta file to report bugs.

## Hooks

To repurpose the fuzzer for some specific bug testing, it can be useful to
monkeypatch archipelago before generation and/or to reclassify some failures.
That's where a hook comes in.

You can declare a class like this one in a file alongside `fuzz.py` in your
archipelago installation:

```py
from fuzz import BaseHook, GenOutcome

class Hook(BaseHook):
    def setup_main(self, args):
        """
        The args parameter is the `Namespace` containing the parsed arguments from the CLI.
        setup is classed as early as possible after argument parsing in the
        main process. It is guaranteed to be only ever called once. It will
        always be called before any worker process is started
        """
        pass

    def setup_worker(self, args):
        """
        The args parameter is the `Namespace` containing the parsed arguments from the CLI.
        setup is classed as early as possible after starting a worker process.
        It is guaranteed to only ever be called once per worker process, before
        any generation attempt.
        """
        pass

    def reclassify_outcome(self, outcome, exception):
        """
        The outcome is a `GenOutcome` from generation.
        The exception is the exception raised during generation if one happened, None otherwise.

        This function is called in the worker process just after the result is first decided.
        The one exception is for timeouts where the outcome has to be processed on the main process.
        As such, this function must do very minimal work and not make
        assumptions as whether it's running in worker or in the main process.
        """
        return GenOutcome.Success

    def before_generate(self, args):
        """
        This method will be called once per generation, just before we actually
        call into archipelago. The `args` argument contains the `Namespace`
        object passed to archipelago for generation. It can be modified since
        this happens before generation.
        """
        pass

    def after_generate(self, multiworld):
        """
        This method will be called once per generation except if the generation timed out.
        If you need to inspect the failure, use `reclassify_outcome` instead.
        If the generation, multiworld is the object returned by archipelago on
        success, otherwise it's None
        """
        pass

    def finalize(self):
        """
        This method will be called once just before the main process exits. It
        will only be called on the main process
        """
        pass
```

You can then pass the following argument: `--hook your_file:Hook`, note that it should be the name of your file, without the extension.
The `hooks` folder in this repository contains examples of some usage that I personally made of hooks.

### Profiler hook

You can get a profile in a callgrind format by using the provided `profile` hook.

Example:

```
python -O fuzz.py -r 1000 -n 1 -g pokemon_crystal -j24 --hook hooks.profile:Hook
```

The output (`fuzz_output/full.prof`) can be read with a tool such as `qcachegrind`.
